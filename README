Run the shell script 
python hw2_seq2seq.sh <Data_Folder> <output_filename.txt>

This script will
- Read in test data specified by Data_Folder
- Load "best_model.pth"
- Evaluate the model over the data
- Run bleu_eval to calculate and return the bleu score

Data_Folder should be nested in a folder named "MLDS_hw2_1_data" and the corresponding .json file should also be located there

In other words, the data structure should be

/Working directory/
bleu_eval
HW2
HW2_supp
hw2_seq2seq.sh


*** This folder must exist to provide the vocabulary to the model
/Working directory/training_data/
feat
video
id


/Working directory/testing_data/

training_label.json
