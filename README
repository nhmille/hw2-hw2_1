# CPSC 8430
# Homework 2: Sequence-to-Sequence Model

## How to run
Run the shell script with the following command usage:
'''bash
python hw2_seq2seq.sh <Specified_Testing_Data> <output_filename.txt>

## How to setup working directory
/Working directory/
bleu_eval.py
HW2.py
HW2_supp.py
hw2_seq2seq.sh

/Working directory/
    MLDS_hw2_1_data/
      training_label.json

      <Specified_Testing_Data>/
          feat
          video
          id
          <Specified_Testing_Data>_label.json


## Explanation of activity:
- Read in test data in the folder specified by Specified_Testing_Data
- Load "best_model.pth"
- Evaluate the model over the data
- Run bleu_eval to calculate and return the bleu score


## Which shell file to run?
Default is "hw2_seq2seq.sh" which calls using "python3"
- My local machine only recognized "python"

I have included a backup
- hw2_seq2seq.sh -> Runs using python3
- hw2_seq2seq_not3.sh -> Runs using python


## Working directory clarification in words:
training_label.json should be located in the nested folder, "MLDS_hw2_1_data"
- Ensures the model can recreate correct vocabulary

Specified_Testing_Data should be a folder nested in "MLDS_hw2_1_data"
- Contains actual feature, video, and id data

All .json should be located in the "MLDS_hw2_1_data" folder
- To ensure creation of correct labels
